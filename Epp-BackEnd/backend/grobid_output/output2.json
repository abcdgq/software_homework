However, the employment of self-attention modules results in a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on approximating the selfattention computation with linear complexity have been made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work shows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in keeping the softmax self-attention during approximations. Specifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Based on this insight, for the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed. To remove softmax in self-attention, Gaussian kernel function is used to replace the dot-product similarity without further normalization. This enables a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. The robustness of the approximation is achieved by calculating its Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. Crucially, with a linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity."

                    "Recently the step change brought by Transformers [34] in natural language processing (NLP) [10,4] seems to have arrived in vision [11,42,48,47]. Indeed, with less inductive bias in its architecture design than Convolution neural networks (CNNs), pure Vision Transformer (ViT) [11] and its variants have shown to be able to outperform CNNs on various vision tasks [8,16]. However, there is a bottleneck in any Transformer based model, namely its quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. This is intrinsic to the self-attention mechanism: given a sequence of tokens (e.g., words or image patches) as input, the self-attention module iteratively learns the feature representations by relating one token to all other tokens. This results in a quadratic complexity O(n 2 ) with the token sequence length n in both computation (time) and memory (space) since an n × n sized attention matrix needs to be computed and saved during inference. This problem is particularly acute in vision: a 2D image after tokenization will produce a far longer sequence than those in NLP even with a moderate spatial resolution. This quadratic complexity thus prevents a ViT model from modeling images at high spatial resolutions, which are often crucial for visual recognition tasks. Figure 1: Top1-Accuracy on ImageNet [9] validation set with respect to parameters and the memory usage corresponding to the token sequence length in practice compared to other methods.

                    "A natural solution is to reduce the complexity of self-attention computation via approximation. Indeed, there have been a number of attempts in NLP [35,5,19,40]. For example, [35] takes a naive approach by shortening the length of Key and Value via learnable projections. Such a coarse approximation would inevitably cause performance degradation. In contrast, [5,18] both leverage the kernel mechanism to approximate softmax normalization to linearize the computation in self-attention. [19] instead adopts a hashing strategy to selectively compute the most similar pairs. Recently, [40] uses Nyström matrix decomposition to reconstruct the full attention matrix with polynomial iteration for approximating the pseudo-inverse of the landmark matrix. Nonetheless, softmax normalization is simply duplicated across the matrix decomposition process, which is theoretically unsound. We empirically found that none of these methods are effective when applied to vision (see Sec. 4.2).",
                    "In this work, we identify that the limitations of existing efficient Transformers are caused by the use of softmax self-attention, and for the first time propose a softmax-free Transformer. More specifically, in all existing Transformers (with or without linearization), a softmax normalization is needed on top of scaled dot-product between token feature vectors [34]. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce a novel softmax-free self-attention mechanism, named as SOFT, with linear complexity O(n) in both space and time. Specifically, SOFT uses Gaussian kernel to define the similarity (self-attention) function without the need for subsequent softmax normalization. With this softmax-free attention matrix, we further introduce a novel low-rank matrix decomposition algorithm for approximation. The robustness of the approximation is theoretically guaranteed by employing a Newton-Raphson method for reliably computing the Moore-Penrose inverse of the matrix.",
                    "We make the following contributions. (I) We introduce a novel softmax-free Transformer with linear space and time complexity. (II) Our attention matrix approximation is achieved through a novel matrix decomposition algorithm with theoretical guarantee. (III) To evaluate our method for visual recognition tasks, we design a family of generic backbone architectures with varying capacities using SOFT as the core self-attention component. Extensive experiments show that with a linear complexity (Figure 1b), our SOFT models can take in as input much longer image token sequences. As a result, with the same model size, our SOFT outperforms the state-of-the-art CNNs and ViT variants on ImageNet [9] classification in the accuracy/complexity trade-off (Figure 1a)."

                    "Core to these NLP and vision transformers is the same self-attention mechanism [34] that computes a self-attention matrix by exhaustively comparing token pairs. This means a quadratic complexity with the sequence length in both space and time, which thus limits the scalability of Transformers in dealing with long sequences. This limitation is more serious in vision than NLP: To process an image with at least thousands of pixels, patch-wise tokenization is a must for Transformers to control the computational cost. Given higher resolution images, the patch size also needs to be enlarged proportionally sacrificing the spatial resolution. This limits the capability of Transformers, e.g., learning fine-grained feature representation as required in many visual recognition tasks.",

For example, [35] learns to shrink the length of Key and Value based on a low-rank assumption. [19] adopts a hashing strategy to selective the most similar pairs and only compute attention among them. [5,18] utilize different kernel functions for approximating softmax-based self-attention matrix. [25] applies random feature mapping on the sequences to approach the original softmax function. [17] decreases the time and memory consumption of the attention matrix by replacing the softmax function with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative. When applied to visual recognition tasks, however, we show that these models have considerable performance degradation compared to the standard Transformers [34] (see Sec. 4.2).",

                    "From Table 1 we can make the following observations: (i) Linear Transformer methods substantially reduce the memory and FLOPs while maintain similar parameter size comparing to the Transformer on the Tiny architecture; (ii) Our approach SOFT achieves the best classification accuracy among all the linearization methods. (iii) Our inference speed is on-par with other compared linear Transformers and our training speed is slightly slower than Nystromformer and both are slower than Performer and Linformer. Note that the slow training speed of our model is mostly due to the Newton-Raphson iteration which can only be applied sequentially for ensuring the accuracy of Moore-Penrose inverse. In summary, due to the on-par inference speed we consider the training cost increase is a price worth paying for our superior accuracy.",
                    "Under the second setting, we focus on the memory efficiency of SOFT against the baselines. Here we follow the ViT [11] network structure, stacking 12 attention layers with hidden dimension d = 384, heads h = 12, bottleneck token sequence length m = 49. Different attention blocks from the three linearized Transformer variants, Linformer [35], Performer [5], and Nyströmformer [40] are studied.",
                    "For each Transformer variant, we adjust its token sequence length n in a linear increment. Specifically, we use a token sequence length of 784 × p where p = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and set batch size 1 to verify whether the memory consumption increases \"quadratically\" or \"linearly\". Figure 1b shows all compared transformer variants including our SOFT indeed have a linear memory usage complexity. This is in contrast with the standard Transformer which cannot cope with long token sequences with a quadratic complexity. Table 3: Evaluation results on ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet-1K [9] validation set. We report the results using the input size of 224x224 pixels center cropped from resized images with 256x256 pixels. M.S.Out. stands for whether the model is designed for multi-scale output. †: Corrected FLOPs by taking into account the cost of attention matrix multiplication overlooked in the origin paper."

(iii) Our SOFT outperforms the most similar (in architecture configuration) Transformer counterparts PVT [36] at all variants. Since the attention module is the main difference, this validates directly the effectiveness of our model.

                    "To gain some insights into how attention is learned using our SOFT and the alternatives, Figure 3 shows the attention masks of various compared models. For each model, we show the output from the first two attention heads. It is evident that SOFT exhibits robustness and versatility in capturing local and long distance relations among pixels. It is interesting to note that, although SOFT is trained on an object categorization dataset in ImageNet [9], it seems to be able to learn both semantic concepts shared across instances in the same category and instance specific features. For instance, in the bottom-right example of a bird class, one attention head focuses on the black bird only, while the other attend to both birds in the image. More examples are shown in Appendix A.4."

                    "Pyramidal architecture: Unlike the earlier non-pyramidal vision Transformers (e.g., ViT [11]), most recent pyramidal (multi-scale) Transformers (e.g., PVT [36]) use convolution layers to reduce the spatial resolution (i.e., token sequence length) between stages. In this study, we ablate SOFT with a pyramidal architecture (our default SOFT-Small), SOFT w/o a pyramidal architecture and DeiT-S [32] (no pyramidal architecture either). We replace the Transformer layer with a SOFT layer to get SOFT w/o a pyramidal architecture. Note all three variants have similar parameters and FLOPs. Table 5a shows that the conv-based pyramidal architecture is clearly superior to a non-pyramidal design, and our non-pyramidal counterpart is even slightly better than DeiT-S [32] whilst enjoying linear complexity. Bottleneck token sequence length: In this study, we examine how the bottleneck token sequence length m, sampled from n tokens, influences the model's performance. We change the bottleneck token sequence length in all stages to 36, 49, 64, 81. Table 4a shows that longer bottleneck token would increase the memory cost and the computational overhead. m = 49 seems to give the best trade-off between the performance and computational overhead. The memory usage is measured with the batch size of 128.",
                    "Token sampling: The sampling function in SOFT can assume different forms. Convolution: The sequence Q ∈ R n×de is first reshaped to a feature map R H×W ×de . r × r convolution kernel with stride of r is applied for downsampling, where r = √ sp. The output channel size is also kept and no bias is used. At last, the feature map is reshaped back to the sequence. Average pooling: using a r × r kernel and r stride, where r = √ sp. Random sampling: m tokens are randomly picked from n tokens. Biased sampling: We pick m tokens with a biased policy. Here, the first m tokens are picked. Table 4b shows that average pooling yields the best performance while with less computational overhead comparing to convolution. Biased sampling can miss the most salient samples, and there is no guarantee that random sampling can keep the uniformity of the chosen samples. This result thus justifies the choice of using average pooling in SOFT. Newton-Raphson's convergence: We study how many iterations the Newton-Raphson method needs to converge when computing the Moore-Penrose inverse A † . We use AA k A -A p / A p with p = 2 (see Proposition 1) as the convergence metric to quantify the difference between A k and A † . Figure 4 shows that our approximation converges within 20 iterations across all stages."

Unlike existing linear Transformers that aim to approximate the conventional softmax based self-attention, SOFT employs a Gaussian kernel based attention which eliminates the need for softmax normalization. This design enables a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. The robustness of the approximation is achieved by calculating its Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Extensive experiments show that SOFT yields superior trade-off in accuracy and complexity."
